# Word Audio Classifier - Intro to ML course project

The goal of the project is to prepare a machine learning module that can be hypothetically
used as a word classifier.

# Setup

```console
$ python -m venv venv
$ venv/bin/activate (Linux) ./venv/Scripts/activate (Win)
$ pip install -e .
```

Additionally, you have to install Torch for cuda by yourself:

```console
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

# Run

The app runs on a GPU if CUDA is available; otherwise, it uses the CPU.

```console
$ python frontend
```
